    "The preprocess_image function performs preprocessing on a single image for it to be used by the model. It first opens an image at a given path and then resizes the image to the target size that the model requires. It then converts the image data to a NumPy array and normalizes pixel values to be within the range [0,1]. Finally, because the model expects inputs to be batches of images, we add an extra dimension to the image tensor. Even though we are only making a prediction on one image at a time, it needs to be treated as part of a batch."

The model is downloaded from the provided URL and incorporated into our new Sequential model as a Keras Layer. The 'trainable' parameter is set to False, indicating that the weights of the pre-trained model are frozen and won't be updated during training. This technique is often referred to as 'Transfer Learning', which leverages the knowledge gained from training a model on a large dataset, in this case, the ImageNet dataset, and applying it to another related problem."
